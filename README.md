# Stock Scout - A Stock Analyzer 📈

### A Python app delivering in-depth information on each stock in your portfolio! 💵💰

## Motivation: 💥
- Sparked by an interest in the stock market, I thought no better way to learn it than to make a Python application based on it!


## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ♻️

### 1. Analysis 🔎
- Using **Notion** defined user stories to highlight the goals of this project from a user perspective
   
### 2. Defining/Planning 📝
- Used the name **Notion** Page to define the APIs, frameworks, and languages needed to create a stock analysis application
  
### 3. Building 🔨
Concluded using Python, pandas, and YFinance to create a real-time stock analyzer for users.
 - Python 
 - Pandas 
 - YFinance API 
   
### 4. Testing 🧑‍🔬
To test this Python application, I implemented tests using PyTest and coverage.py to find code coverage
- PyTest 
  
### 5. Deployment ✈️
To deploy a Python app that is easily accessible to users, I have found that the Dockerizing the code base to make it easily accessible is the best solution
- Docker 

### 6. Maintenance 🚧
To maintain a robust and coherent code base, I have engineered a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions
- GitHub Actions
